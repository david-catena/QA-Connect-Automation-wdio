# QA-Connect-Automation-wdio
This is a repo to house the POC for the WDIO framework for automation using WebdriverIO

## General Information

* The tests are written using typescript. The tests can be run by directly calling the .ts files but the classes need to be in .js to work with them.

* The config is all set up to run the tests with these specific configurations for TS use. These can be changed if needed

* Below I will add steps to install and run as well as how to set up your own setup locally and configure to run using typescript

## Installation

* Clone the repo onto your local
* cd into the project folder
* install all of the dependencies and run
$ npm install
$ npm test

## Configure locally from scratch
